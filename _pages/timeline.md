#### NOTE
(2024/12/23) To accommodate the short challenge period, **we have decided to extend the challenge by one week**. Please note the following updates:

1. Blind-Test Phase Postponement
    - The blind-test phase, originally scheduled for **Jan. 13–15, is now rescheduled to Jan. 20–22**.
    - The paper submission deadline remains unchanged.

2. Subjective Evaluation Adjustments
    - Due to the shortened evaluation timeline, the subjective evaluation will be conducted in two stages:
        - Stage 1: During the challenge period, **we will evaluate only the English subset for the subjective metric (i.e., MOS score). This score will contribute to the final ranking**. Note that **the other metrics for the other languages will still be computed and included in the final scoring** (refer to https://urgent-challenge.github.io/urgent2025/rules/ for details on how the final score is calculated).
        - Stage 2: AFTER the challenge concludes, we will evaluate MOS scores in the other languages. Although the MOS scores in the other languages do NOT contribute to the final ranking, in the other languages, this extended analysis will offer participants deeper insights into their system performance across multiple languages.
