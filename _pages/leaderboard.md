### Note

In the leaderboard, there are two official entries:
  * The entry submitted by the user `urgent` represents the official baseline.
  * The entry submitted by the user `noisy` represents the result of the original noisy input speech (without enhancement).

### How to read the leaderboard?

  * Each row represents the best submission from one user (team).
  * For all evaluation phases, there are four categories of metrics for each submission: non-intrusive SE metrics, intrusive SE metrics, downstream-task-independent metrics, and downstream-task-dependent metrics. Each category includes several metrics.
      * For each metric cell, the first number represents the metric value, and the second number in parentheses represents the rank of this metric among all submissions.
      * For the final blind test phase, an additional category (`Subjective SE metrics`) will be added to evaluate the MOS score. See [`Data`](/urgent2025/data) for more information.
  * The last column (overall ranking score) represents the final score used for ranking all submissions. It is calculated following the rules defined in the [`Rules`](/urgent2025/rules) tab.
