* **[2024-12-25]** The leaderboard is swithed to the non-blind test phase and the non-blind test set has been released. It can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxV6RgA4LAp2I1EnHsln7wI7-UCP6Qer/view).

* **[2024-12-23]** We have updated the [`Rules`](/urgent2025/rules) page to clarify the policy regarding the use of pre-trained speech enhancement models. **Using pre-trained speech enhancement models trained on data other than the official Challenge dataset is NOT allowed**. Refer to [`Rules`](/urgent2025/rules) page for more details.

* **[2024-12-23]** To accommodate the short challenge period, we have decided to extend the challegnge period for one week. The blind-test phase, originally scheduled for Jan. 13–15, is now rescheduled to Jan. 20–22. Due to the shortened evaluation timeline, the subjective evaluation protocol will change. Please refer to [`Timeline`](/urgent2025/timeline) page for more details.

* **[2024-11-26]** We have released the checkpoint of the baseline TF-GridNet model at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/kohei0209/tfgridnet_urgent25/tree/main).

* **[2024-11-26]** We have opened the leaderboard and released the `official valdation set` for leaderbord submission. Refer to [`Submission`](/urgent2025/submission) and [`Data`](/urgent2025/data) pages for more details.
